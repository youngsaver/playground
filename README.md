# Soulsmile/SkewTheScript Playgroud

Dashiell Young-Saver. Courses I'm taking this semester:
- CS107 (obvi)
- CS109a (auditing because took it during undergrad)
- Stat 151 (Multilevel Models)
- Econ 1078 (Analyzing Education Policy with Econometrics)
- CS171 (Visualization)

A place to play with `git`.
